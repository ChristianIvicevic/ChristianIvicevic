## Hi there, I'm Christian! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer based in Sydney, Australia, currently consulting on digital banking platforms at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.

Previously, I taught high school mathematics and worked in academia while studying Computer Science, Mathematics, and Educational Psychology. After transitioning into software engineering, I took a sabbatical to travel and recalibrate. Now fully reengaged, I'm working on large-scale systems in high-stakes environments.
