## Hi there, I'm Christian! ðŸ‘‹

I used to be a software engineer and teacher working in Munich, Germany - currently, I'm on a sabbatical for a few months.

Previously I have been studying Computer Science, Mathematics and Educational Psychology while working at the university as a teaching assistant and later as a high school teacher before pursuing a career as a software engineer.
